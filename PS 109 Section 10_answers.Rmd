Today, we will be using the 'trustgov_trustgrev' and 'dem_hisptyp_1st' variables. 

* What kind of variables are these?
* What does the 'trustgov_trustgrev' measure? 

```{r}
#subset variables so we only look at the continous measures (1-7 for 'dem_hisp_typ_1st' and 1-5 for 'trustgov_trustgrev')


```
